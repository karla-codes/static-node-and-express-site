# Static Node and Express Site

Portfolio site built using Node.js, Express, and Pug.

## Objective

Use Node.js, Express, and Pug to build a portfolio site to display all of my Treehouse projects so far.

## Extra Credit

- changed font to **Karla** in `style.css`
- added hover animation to text links that add a text shadow in `bonus.css`
