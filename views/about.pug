          p Hello! I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer with an interest in UX and UI design. My interest in web development came from a desire to help people and my love for design and technology. When I discovered coding, I was hooked. Code allowed me to solve problems in creative ways, build user-friendly products, and make fun and interactive web experiences. Since then, I've been on a self-teaching journey, learning from amazing resources like Treehouse, SuperHi, and Skillcrush (and Google). 
          p My goal is to use my skills to build clean, efficient, and creative user experiences that focus on accessibility and simplicity. With my background in design, I hope to fuse the creative and technical aspects of web development to help build well-balanced products. 
          p When I'm not typing away in VS Code, you can find me on a hike, playing video games with my husband, cuddling with my cats, or baking banana bread (with chocolate chips and walnuts, of course!).
